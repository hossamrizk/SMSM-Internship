# SMSM Internship Journey

Welcome to the repository showcasing my work during the SMSM internship, as well as other significant projects. This repository includes datasets and models developed for various machine learning tasks.

## Datasets

### 1. **CCTV Gender Classifier Dataset**

**Description**: A curated dataset of images captured from CCTV cameras, organized for the purpose of gender classification. The images are categorized into two classes: MALE and FEMALE, providing a balanced and diverse dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models.

### 2. **Car Brands in Egypt Dataset**

**Description**: This dataset includes information on 16 car brands available in Egypt, such as BMW, Chevrolet, Honda, Hyundai, and others. It was collected and organized to assist in car brand classification tasks, providing a comprehensive overview of the car market in Egypt.

## Projects

### 1. **Egyptian to English Translation**

**Description**: This project involved fine-tuning Helsinki and M2M Models for the task of translating Egyptian Arabic to English. The models were optimized to handle the nuances of dialectal Arabic, improving translation accuracy.

### 2. **CCTV Gender Classification using Transfer Learning**

**Description**: Implemented gender classification using transfer learning with the ResNet-50 architecture in PyTorch. This project utilized the CCTV Gender Classifier Dataset and aimed to enhance model performance in distinguishing between male and female subjects in images.
